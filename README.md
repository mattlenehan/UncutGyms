Features to improve the user experience:
- offer ability to "Search this area" for new results after the map has moved a certain distance away from origin
- support searching businesses by more defined categories i.e. Yoga, Crossfit, PT, etc
- add capability to sort from the List view by price, rating, reviews, etc
- allow for marking as favorite
- in addition to "Call Business", CTA buttons to connect on IG, FB, and email would be useful
- support auto-playing videos in hero image space
- the pre-loaded directions aren't helpful but adding travel time up front and ability to open in Maps or Waze would provide value
- dark mode support
